# RandomChordGenerate
a simple tool to generate triads and seventh chords

warning:I thought I can write some python scripts that can print some random chords originally,but somehow I think it was better to have GUI,I choose front-end to write it which I'm familiar with.And now,it's wired to see that I used flask to link front and back end,and I have no idea how to run it on android or ios without a server.By the way,it's my first time to write flask,back-end,local storage,etc.,so I think this is a good practice and a useful tool for me but not a good project.

## Function Introduction

### Complete Random Mode
> You can choose whether root note will have accidentals,the chords' types which is divided into 4 categories.

### Diatonic Random Mode
> You can choose a root note,a mode,the chords' types(triad or seventh chords),and then generate chords in the mode you choose.In this mode,you can open the "Show chord series" option.

### Custom Chord Progression Mode
> Coming soon!Which will allow you to create a custom chord progression varying with the metronome.

### Metronome
> You can use the metronome to practice you musical instrument,and can choose whether the random chord will be generated on the first beat of every bar.

### Show Chord Information

#### Future Plan
* More beatiful UI.
* Custom Chord Progression Mode.
* More modes such as harmonic minor,pentatonic scale.
